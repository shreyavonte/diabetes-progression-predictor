# Diabetes Progression Predictor
A lightweight ML web app predicting 1-year diabetes progression using BMI and blood glucose (S5). Built with Lasso Regression on the sklearn diabetes dataset. Features an interactive Streamlit UI for real-time inference via input sliders. Ideal for analyzing health metric impacts.

## About the Project
This interactive web app helps visualize how changes in health metrics can affect diabetes progression. Built with **Lasso Regression** on the **scikit-learn diabetes dataset**, and powered by **Streamlit** for an intuitive user interface.

## Features
-  Predicts 1-year diabetes progression using just **BMI** and **S5 (blood sugar)** levels.
-  Uses **Lasso Regression** for efficient feature selection and accurate results.
-  Interactive sliders for real-time input changes and dynamic prediction updates.
-  Great for visual insights into how small changes in health indicators can impact disease risk.

## TechStack
- Python
- sci-kit learn
- Streamlit
- numpy and pandas
- Matplotlib (for optional plotting)
